<h2> How would this data set change the way you think about space? </h2>
<p> This data shows how age distributes around NSW, thus following the trend, it correlates to the cost of housing where
young adults are unable to afford housing in the suburbs and would rent apartments in the city to be closer to work. 
They are also concentrated around Rhodes, Homebush, Burwood and Parramatta, where there are more apartment complexes.
