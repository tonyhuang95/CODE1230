<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The data set consists of the age of individuals living in Australia separated by sex. It can be seen from the data that the median age in NSW is 37.6 years old, and the male to female ratio is 98.5. This data is collected to provide information to the public and private sectors to improve Sydney's housing and social implications. From this data, it can be seen to correlate to housing cost, where young adults are unable to afford housing in suburbs and would rent apartments in the city to be closer to work. These are concentrated around Parramatta, Burwood, Homebush, Rhodes, Zetland and the CBD, where majority of the suburb are apartment developments. Young families looking for housing with more space have had to move further west in areas such as The Ponds and Badgery Creek due to the cheaper housing and new urban development. Older people tend to live along the waterfront for a relaxed lifestyle or move towards the rural areas of NSW. This implicates that CBDs are planned to be high density due to work opportunities and the suburbs are lower density to allow space for families.

<h2>Public & Private Sectors</h2>
<p><b>Public | Department of Education and Training</b><br>Responsible for national policies and programs that help Australians access quality and affordable eaerly child care and childhood education, school education, higher education, vocational education and training, internation education and research. The department can utilise this data to ensure optimal distribution of their education and training centres. Also, the information of areas with an influx of new residents could prompt new facilities that could be planned for in advance.

<p><b>Public | Department of Employment</b><br>Responsible for national policies and programs that help Australians find and keep employment and work in safe, fair and productive workplaces. The department can utilise this data along with unemployment data to target areas with large numbers of 20-60 year olds occupying to ensure effective awareness in those areas. 
</p>
<p><b>Public | Department of Social Services</b><br>Responsible for national policies and programs that help deliver a strong and fair society for all Australians, it developes and implements social policies that supports housing affordability, child support, social housing, services for older people and more. The department can utilise this data to determine the major hubs for older people and young families to assist in their works.
</p>
<p><b>Private | Aged Care facilities</b><br> This sector is able to use this data to determine where to place new facilities to ensure optimal integration into the area, as well as plan for future growths. In order to meet the demand of families, the data can assist in determining the size of the facility.

</p>
<p><b>Private | Private Health Insurance</b><br> This sector uses this data to determine which areas will buy health insurance the most by inspecting the major hubs for young families and older people. This will assist them in expansion and providing services for residents in the area of their shop best. 
<h2>Changes Across Sydney</h2>
<p>In general children live out of the city with their parents, young adults begin to occupy the city after 20 and move out into the suburbs again when they're around 40 to accomodate better for their new families. Detailed analysis below:</p>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>This data is significant to the residences of Sydney as it shows general areas where they should be at their age. For example, occupy the suburbs when starting a family, the CBD after high school and begin work, peaceful waterfront suburbs for retirement. These areas represent a goal for residences to strive towards, however, due to the housing boom this is difficult for many as shown by the map above. Resulting in huge urban developments 40KMs away from the CBD, where adults would have to commute hours to their job in the CBD. Age distribution and population growth affects the city's urban planning in the public and private sectors. 
</p>
<h2>Potential Changes</h2>
<p>It is shown by the data that CBD life is for young adults without children that want to live close to work, and that the suburbs are for families due to their land size. This distinction between the two would be hard to change as Sydney population density requires apartments in major CBDs to reduce commutes, the only feasible change would be introducing a central hub similar to parramatta below the latte line so that there are more job opportunities. This would also even out the house pricing and quality of life across the latte line. It can also be seen that past the age of 40, the distribution across the latte line is more even as housing boom had not affected them, and it is common to see these people occupy a 4 to 6 bedroom house closer to the CBD by themselves. A policy that could be introduced to reduced these incidences to free up these houses for younger families so they are more evenly distributed across Sydney.
