<h1>AGE 0-19</h1>
The proportion of age 0 to 19 out of the entire population is dislayed by the height on the map. The change of population from 2011 to 2016 is displayed by the colours where black represents a decrease and red an increase. It is observed that there is a general increase in a majority of suburbs due to generic population growth, and the model is adjusted to that by setting a 8% increase as the datum to represent a 8% total population growth.<br><br>
The latte line does not provide solid analysis due to the fact that house pricing has been increasing dramatically in the past 5 years, thus younger families have to move out towards the North West or South West. <br><br>
Specific areas of interest: <br>
<li>The Ponds - Due to recent developments of new affordable housing, shops, and schools, causiing an influx of young families in the past 5 years.</li>
<li>Sydney Olympic Park - A redeveloped area that emphasises on work, live and play has attracted young families with their modern apartments.</li>
<li>Edmondson Park - A South West growth center with new developments in the past 5 years, including a new train station and shopping centre. Attracting young families to occupy the housing.
<li>UNSW, USYD and MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY - High growth in the past years due to evergrowing campuses, also has higher proportion of the population.</li>
<li>Badgery Creek - Introduction of the new Airport, which requires a large land area, requiring residences to move away.</li>
<li>Outer Sydney - These areas such as the shire, blue mountains and campbelltown have had a decrease in population due to a poorer quality of life that is generally looked for by young families.</li>
