<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The data set consists of the age of individuals living in Australia separated by sex. It can be seen from the data that the median age in NSW is 37.6 years old, and the male to female ratio is 98.5. This data is collected to provide information to the public and private sectors to improve Sydney's housing and social implications. From this data, it can be seen to correlate to housing cost, where young adults are unable to afford housing in suburbs and would rent apartments in the city to be closer to work. These are concentrated around Parramatta, Burwood, Homebush, Rhodes, Zetland and the CBD, where majority of the suburb are apartment developments. Young families looking for housing with more space have had to move further west in areas such as The Ponds and Badgery Creek due to the cheaper housing and new urban development. Older people tend to live along the waterfront for a relaxed lifestyle or move towards the rural areas of NSW. This implicates that CBDs are planned to be high density due to work opportunities and the suburbs are lower density to allow space for families.
</p>

<h2>Changes Across Sydney</h2>
<p>In general children live out of the city with their parents, young adults begin to occupy the city after 20 and move out into the suburbs again when they're around 40 to accomodate better for their new families. Detailed analysis below:</p>

<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>This data is significant to the residences of Sydney as it shows general areas where they should be at their age. For example, occupy the suburbs when starting a family, the CBD after high school and begin work, peaceful waterfront suburbs for retirement. These areas represent a goal for residences to strive towards, however, due to the housing boom this is difficult for many as shown by the map above. Resulting in huge urban developments 40KMs away from the CBD, where adults would have to commute hours to their job in the CBD. </p><br>
<h1> Would it be good to keep this data the same across sydney. </h1>
